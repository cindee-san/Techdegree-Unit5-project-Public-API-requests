# Techdegree-Unit5-project-Public-API-requests

For this project, I built an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
